# Face_identification

## Description:
Algorithm performing face identification via supervised learning using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The CNN was trained using a set of images featuring two different persons, which the CNN must learn to distinguish. 

## Personal development goals:
- Practising developing a Convolutional Neural Network using [Keras](https://github.com/fchollet/keras).
- Playing with the [Image Augmentation tool](https://github.com/ethilliez/Image_augmentation) I previously developed.
- Preparing a model to recognize people for a future real-time person identification tool.
- Practising performing the same task with Tensorflow/Caffe ?

## Status of development:
For Keras implementation:
- Code Skeletion created

## Requirements:

## Execution:
